TODO list!

- Make it easier to specify/change magic bytes
- Make it easier to specify the fake program name
- Option to change parent process name to hide its presence
- ELFcrypt/ELFparasite to hide this better and create persistence
- Test on other platforms: BSD, Mac, etc.
- Use ip and icmp structures rather than referencing byte positions in packets
